## 💡 The 4-Layer Insight Engine

Unlike conventional dashboards that only display charts, every visual is accompanied by an automated, structured insight card:
1. **Finding:** The observed empirical pattern from the chart.
2. **Evidence:** Exact computed numbers, shares, and ratios from the dataset.
3. **Business Interpretation:** Strategic meaning without making unsupported causal claims.
4. **Operational Implication:** Direct operational takeaways for logistics, merchandising, or customer retention.
